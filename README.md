## Paired device manager overview

This is a proof of concept of a system that can track devices talking to a hub within a dwelling. In this case we can have a device attached to multiple hubs and a hub can be on multiple dwellings. At this point it does not handle those edge cases.

There is no attached UI of any sort and all creation is done simply through tests.

To run tests -> 
`python -m unittest`
